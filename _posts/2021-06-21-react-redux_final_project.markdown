For my last and final project of this course, I created a simple Bookshelf application that mimics the basic features of Goodreads.com. It allows users to create a shelf and add books to each shelf. Despite the simplicity of this project, it incorporates all the requirements and was an excellent way to learn the most confusing aspects of react and redux.

Considering my course is expiring in 9 days, I will be submitting an MVP version of this project. Down the road when I have time I am really looking forward to implementing several features to this including: 

1. Using the Google Books API to search for books by Name, Author, ISBN etc.
2. Implementing more design features using bootstrap...perhaps a carousel of images of book covers for each shelf
3. User login capabilities.
4. Nav Bar
5. Reviews and or notes/comments for each book.

I am so excited to have finally finished my last and final project and can't wait to begin this next chapter!
