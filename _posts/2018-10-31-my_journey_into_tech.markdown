I had been working in the luxury hotel industry for over 13 years. The career had served me well over the decade, but I couldn't resist the idea of being involved with something that created more of an impact on the world than simply catering to the whims of absurdly wealthy people. 

On a short trip back home, I met with an old friend from high school who had just begun working at a startup. He spoke non-stop about his experience and how much he felt I would love working in web development. I didn't understand why he considered me of all people to be a good fit for this industry, but it certainly piquéd my interest. In hindsight, I'm the the kind of person who is constantly looking for some type of intellectual stimulation via books, podcasts, documentaries, and even crossword/sudoku puzzles in the morning paper, so I now understand his reasoning.

Rewind several years to high school and college. Math and science were my forté. Something about working through a difficult problem step by step and finding that one right answer just gave me so much more satisfaction than any philosophy or history class ever could. And despite my success in the required computer science classes, a career in tech NEVER crossed my mind as a possibility. My teenage self completely succumbed to the stereotypical idea that careers in STEM were reserved for smart, geeky men (horrible thought, I know). 

Almost immediately after I returned home, I started my research and enrolled in a few free online web development courses. I studied with whatever free time I had and quickly expanded my interest in the idea of a total career change. As fate would have it, about a year and a half later my husband was transferred to work on a remote island country off the coast of Africa. With few other job opportunities available...I saw my chance. Equipped with Wi-Fi, a laptop, limited distractions and endless free time at my disposal, I decided it was time to dive headfirst into making this career change my priority. 

Enter Flatiron School. I had read nothing but great things about their program and was over the moon when I was granted the Women Take Tech scholarship. I'm sure there will be countless obstacles along the way, but that's probably where all the fun is. I can't wait to be a part of such a fast-paced field, and to join the growing number of men and women who are helping to close the gender gap in tech.
