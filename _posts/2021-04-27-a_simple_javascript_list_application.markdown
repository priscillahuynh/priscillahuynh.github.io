For my Javascript project I decided to create the most basic application I could think of. Yes...another to-do list. Yawn I know. But hear me out....

I've been slowly chipping away at this entire course for three years now. A fact I am not too proud to share. This legacy program is going to expire at the end of June so I'm hitting the gas to get this done and finally earn my certificate. 

Despite the simplicity of the app, I learned so much during the development process. I am really looking forward to having the time to create something I am more passionate and excited about. But I digress. This project is complete and I am so proud of myself for everything I have learned. On to the next section!
